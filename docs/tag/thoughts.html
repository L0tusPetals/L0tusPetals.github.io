<p>As the world faces unprecedented challenges — climate change, rising inequality, mass displacement, and violence — one would expect the most powerful leaders to steer us toward unity, compassion, and science-based policies. Yet, in the case of Donald Trump, we seem to be witnessing the opposite.
It’s hard to reconcile how the former U.S. President — arguably the second most influential person on the planet — could take such regressive stances. Championing fossil fuel extraction for jobs might sound patriotic on paper, but it’s akin to cutting the very branch we’re all sitting on. Climate change is no longer a distant threat — it’s a daily reality. Ignoring it, or worse, denying it, is a direct assault on the future of humanity.
Even more troubling is the glorification of gun rights in a country already struggling with gun violence. What kind of society are we creating where citizens feel safer armed than protected? Shouldn’t we evolve into a non-violent, civilized race rather than prepare for dystopia?
The idea of “Putting America First” is not inherently wrong — every nation must prioritize its people. But when that slogan is used to justify isolationism, xenophobia, and environmental disregard, it stops being about patriotism and starts becoming a political shield for narrow-minded self-interest.
What has Trump done for humanity at large? Very little that wasn’t politically calculated. His peace deals, criminal justice reforms, and economic moves — even when praised — were often driven by optics, not altruism. In contrast, cultural icons like Michael Jackson (ironically also American) envisioned a world of empathy and healing. “Heal the World,” “Man in the Mirror” — these weren’t just songs. They were blueprints for leadership with a conscience.
This isn’t just about America. It’s about the kind of civilization we are becoming. As a global citizen, I believe we deserve leaders who don’t just aim to win votes, but who dare to uplift humanity.</p>
